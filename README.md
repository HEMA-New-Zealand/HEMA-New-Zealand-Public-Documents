# HEMA-New-Zealand

Living documentation and policies published by HEMA New Zealand.

Major release, minor release and hotfix structure denoted by 3 numbers/two decimal points.
e.g. 1.0.0 is first major release for a specific document.

Draft policies are made available for public viewing and consultation, during this phase the draft can be reformed according to consult advice.

Draft policies that successfully pass the Consultation phase are finally decided upon by the executive members of HEMA New Zealand. Upon approval, they are promoted to Published policies - wherein they must be adhered to for clubs and events to achieve Affiliation status.

Documentation is open to submissions from HEMA New Zealand members via pull request or email.
Submissions and other edits are able to be applied by executive members - changes like this should follow processes defined in the constitution.

Documents will be written and published in markdown: https://www.markdownguide.org/

## Why are we using Github?

A software development platform may not appear the most intuitive platform for hosting documentation for a union of sword clubs, but Git (and it's most popular online host Github) offers a number of benefits for hosting live documents:

1. Free hosting
2. Open plaintext-based formatting that is easy to edit
3. Tracked changes and version control
4. Configurable change proposal and approval processes baked into the platform
5. Capacity to incorporate a CI pipeline that will publish these documents to an actual website (eventually).

## Sounds good, how do I actually use this thing?

The basics:

1. You will need a Github account.
2. Fork a new branch off from the main branch.
3. Make changes inside your branch.
   1. Once you've done this, commit these changes to your branch.
4. Make a Pull Request, to merge your branch back into the main repo.
   1. Your branch Pull Request will notify the team for review before being either rejected or incorporated into the repository's main branch.
