# Draft Policy Documents

Draft Policies are posted by the committee members of HEMA New Zealand and posted here to be publicly available for viewing.
General members of HEMA New Zealand (and members of the public) may then submit alterations by way of pull request or email submission.

Draft policies are not enforced nor are they required to be incorporated by local clubs in order to achieve Affiliation status (for the clubs or the events they organise)
