# Ironfolk Combat - Code Of Conduct

## Values

Ironfolk Combat strives to create an environment of safety, fun, and supportiveness that is accessible to anyone who wishes to participate. As a club, we organise around our core values:

* Safety  
* Camaraderie  
* Fun  
* Learning

These values serve as a guide for members to ensure that we all participate in the way we mean to proceed. This document seeks to further break down these values, provide a guide to member conduct, and sets out the actions and procedures for recognising problems or issues with a members conduct.

### Safety

Within a HEMA club, safety is paramount, we must recognise the inherent danger in swinging steel at each other and take all necessary steps to ensure our own safety and the safety of other members of the club. We must also recognise that a safe environment is not just masks and padding, and ensure that our club is a safe space for all of our members to learn, practice, and participate.

* We recognise safety is paramount  
* We all take responsibility for ensuring safety during club activities  
* We wear correct protective equipment for our activity  
* We communicate  
* We seek and obtain consent  
* We ask for, understand, and recognise the needs of others  
* We receive feedback  
* We do not tolerate unsafe behaviour  
* We speak up  
* We guide gently

### Camaraderie

We recognise that to ensure our club remains stable, we must build and maintain relationships between members, and ensure that ours is a club that maintains a safe and inclusive environment that recognises the varied needs of our fellow members. We aim to build a strong sense of kinship and belonging by ensuring that all members are recognised, involved, seen, heard, and feel valued during club time.

* We respect each other  
* We listen  
* We communicate  
* We include  
* We value input  
* We seek to understand  
* We seek to resolve

### Fun

As a core value, we aim to recognise that no member needs to be here, and that enjoying ourselves and the company we keep is a large part of why we do what we do. By including this here we understand that fun is key to ensuring a successful and thriving club, with a culture we can be proud of.

* We have fun together  
* We don’t take ourselves too seriously  
* We communicate  
* We are inclusive and positive  
* We reinforce the enjoyment of others

### Learning

Ironfolk Combat is a learning environment and we aim to ensure that all members are able to learn (and teach) the things that they are interested in. We are all here to be sword people, and learning is key to this goal.

* We listen  
* We guide  
* We communicate  
* We are respectful when we disagree  
* We debate, we don’t argue  
* We are clear, and concise

## Conduct

This section serves as a guide for members to understand that there are actions we will not tolerate as a club. This is not an exhaustive list, and it should be noted that any action deemed inconsistent with our club values, or otherwise deemed inappropriate by the club/club leaders may result in disciplinary action.

Club leaders reserve the right to add to or amend this list at any time without notice as required, with the expectation that members will be consulted before the change, or as soon as possible after, as appropriate.

### Discrimination and Harassment

1. Ironfolk Combat celebrates diversity, and recognises that there is value in growing more diverse. We will not tolerate discrimination for any reason, we aim to be a welcoming, safe space for diverse identities, whether it be of culture, gender, sexuality, race, religion, politics, or otherwise. We expect that members will be respectful and welcoming of any member regardless of their background. We recognise that not all backgrounds will always agree with everything, we ask that members respectfully keep their views to themselves where likely to cause conflict that is not relevant or helpful.

    1. For clarity, any views that conflict with the validity of the identity of a member are not welcome, this is not the place for discourse,and these discussions are not useful. It should be a given that members are entitled to their identity.

2. It is critical to note that we will not tolerate, nor welcome or include, any member with views that inherently disregard the validity of other cultures or identities including (but not limited to) Naziism (or any form of White Supremacy), not recognising gender diversity, or religion that is unable to tolerate diversity. This is not a matter of ‘keep it to yourself’, if you’re a Nazi, you aren’t welcome in our club, cry about it.

3. There is no excuse for unwanted physical contact, it is easy to ask for consent. We expect all members to ask for consent before touching another person, and we ask that members communicate and are clear about their physical boundaries during these discussions.  

    1. We ask that members never assume consent, unless an explicit discussion about implicit consent has been had between the two members, and a distinct understanding has been reached. In these situations, we expect members to be clear with their boundaries, and regularly communicate to ensure the safety of everyone involved.

4. Our club deals in controlled action with various weapons and simulators. While these lend themselves to aggressive action, violence of any kind will not be tolerated. Any action taken upon another member or property in anger or otherwise emotionally, with or without a weapon in hand will not be accepted.

5. Bullying will not be tolerated. We ask that members that are feeling bullied talk to club leaders, or other members, as appropriate. We take bullying allegations seriously, and we expect members to receive feedback around their behaviour and change. In the case of bullying allegations, initially a discussion will be had with the relevant member. If there is not an immediate and ongoing change in behaviour, further action will be taken as appropriate.

### Equipment/Property

Members will treat club equipment (including the equipment of other members) as if it were their own, if not better.

Members will not intentionally take action to damage/ break equipment or property, including their own, on club time. This is dangerous, and disrespectful to other members.

Members will ensure any equipment that they use is safe and appropriately maintained. Damaged or dangerous equipment will not be used, and burrs, sharp edges, and other dangerous elements will be removed before use of any equipment.

Members will ensure that they are wearing adequate safety equipment for an activity, as per the Ironfolk equipment guidelines. Typically, we will expect that members are at least wearing a mask for any contested activity, and will typically require a mask for compliant/co-operative activities also. These requirements increase, depending on weapon and intensity.

### Event Conduct

As representatives of the club, members are expected to comply with the Code of Conduct at any event including events hosted by other clubs.

Ironfolk Combat has established a reputation in the HEMA community for building kinship and sportspersonship. Members are expected to maintain positive, sportly conduct, in line with our values, while representing our club at events.

For clarity, HEMA in Aotearoa New Zealand is a small community, we must take the clubs reputation very seriously. Damage to our reputation caused by an individual will be dealt with appropriately by club leaders.

## Discipline

We expect members to comply with NZ law at all times while representing the club. Members are also expected to comply with the law in any other country they may visit as a representative of Ironfolk Combat. Any illegal actions will be dealt with by the appropriate authorities.

Breaches of the Code of Conduct, or any other misconduct as determined by the Club/Club Leaders, will be dealt with on a case by case basis. In many cases, we will take a restorative communication based approach, however we recognise that this is not always ideal.

### Major Misconduct

Major misconduct will largely consist of, intentional, recurring, repeated, or negative behaviour breaching one or many of the conduct expectations or values as outlined in the code of conduct. This may also include illegal activity, or breaches which tangibly impact the club’s standing or reputation in the wider community. In most cases, we will take the impact of the action, and the views of the victim (where relevant) on board when deciding on an approach.

By decision of the club/club leaders, upon discovery of major misconduct, relevant action will be taken, including but not limited to:

* Initiating an investigation  
* Immediate expulsion from the club  
* Alerting the appropriate authorities  
* Suspension from the club  
* Suspension/ban from competition  
* Demotion from a leadership position  
* Other disciplinary action, including behaviour plans/restorative resolutions

### Minor Misconduct

Minor misconduct is defined as breaches of the club Values/ conduct expectations on a minor scale. Repeated breaches, or patterns of behaviour will be defined as Major Misconduct as above. In the case of minor misconduct, we will focus on a restorative approach, including but not limited to:

* Discussion about the behaviour  
* Guidance on appropriate conduct  
* Mediation  
* Restorative resolutions processes  
* Issuing a warning  
* Suspension from club activities  
* Suspension from competition

## Admin Note

A Code of Conduct can be viewed as a doom and gloom document, in place to allow us to deal with anti-social behaviour as a collective. In practice, we aim to have a culture in place where issues are legitimate mistakes or miscommunications, and are dealt with courageously with immediate feedback and brave conversation. This document serves as a tool for situations where this is not possible or appropriate, and a guide for members on how we can achieve this culture together.

Each member will be provided a digital copy of this document. So long as this document has been provided to a member, the member, by participating in club activities, agrees that they have read and understood this document, and to act in accordance with club values and conduct expectations at all times.

In the situation of an identified instance of misconduct of a club member not yet covered by the code of conduct, club leaders may choose to add this instance to the document without notice. In this case, leaders will need to reach agreement that this change is in line with club values.
In most cases leaders will consult with membership prior to making a change, however it may not always be appropriate, in which case, members will be consulted after the fact, and relevant changes made upon receiving feedback.

If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to have a discussion with any of our club leaders who can table any addition or amendment for club discussion.
