## Minutes
Opened 19:00

Discussion topics and sentiments:

- Objective: explicit inclusion of each of sport, martial art, research. 
	- Advocacy under each heading. 
	- Should be registered not-for-profit. 
	
- Clubs as members, but what counts as HEMA? What overlap with reenactment should we have? Is it enough to have carrots and have clubs self-sort?
	- Members should need to be unincorperated/incorperated/business, so they have documents; need effective constitution. 
	- Need to be compatible with policies (e.g. code of conduct), and following said policies. 
	- If a club decides to leave, 30 days after notice they lost rights and obligations. 
	- Ensure dispute resolution policy can handle clubs not following own policies. 

- Need explicit process for consulting on policies as well as voting. 
	- Given consultation process exists, is a single vote per club fine?
	- Given consultation process, equal votes for each club should be fine. 

- Benefits/responsibilities
	- Tournaments would need to be recognised/accredited to permit some grants. 

- For officers, individuals would nominate, clubs would vote. 5 officers?
	- Will need terms and elections. 2 year term?
	- Officers would be responsible for day-to-day operations, and anything already approved by members according to policy. 
	- Any policy changes would require member consultation and votes. 

- Constitutional changes should require a different procedure than policy changes. 2/3 (?) instead of 50%. 

- Sports bodies pay ACC levy. Look up our obligations and ensure dues can cover this plus more.
