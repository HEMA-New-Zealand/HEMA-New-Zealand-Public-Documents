Major release, minor release and hotfix structure denoted by 3 numbers/two decimal points.
e.g. 1.0.0 is first major release for a specific document.

Draft policies are made available for public viewing and consultation, during this phase the draft can be reformed according to consult advice.

Draft policies that successfully pass the Consultation phase are finally decided upon by the executive members of HEMA New Zealand. Upon approval, they are promoted to Published policies - wherein they must be adhered to for clubs and events to achieve Affiliation status.

Documentation is open to submissions from HEMA New Zealand members via pull request or email.
Submissions and other edits are able to be applied by executive members - changes like this should follow processes defined in the constitution.
