# Club Exemplar Documents

By hosting other clubs' policies and constitutions, HEMA New Zealand is able to confirm an alignment of expectations and minimum standards regarding acceptable behaviour and equipment.

Executive members of new clubs on the journey towards officially registering as a society and affiliating with HEMA New Zealand may use these exemplars as starting points,
to help define the goals and culture of their nascent club in a way that aligns with the wider HEMA Community in New Zealand.
