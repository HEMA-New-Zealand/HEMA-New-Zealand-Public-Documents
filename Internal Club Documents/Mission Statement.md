# HEMA New Zealand

## Mission Statement

Version 1.0.0

HEMA New Zealand has formed to promote Historical European Martial Arts throughout Aotearoa New Zealand.

We aim to achieve the following:

- Promote safe practices in the training and execution of HEMA
- Maintain standards of behaviour across HEMA clubs in New Zealand
- Support members and affiliate clubs with information resources
- Investigate and enforce breaches of behavioural and safety standards amongst affiliate clubs

We are **not** a governing body.
Affiliate clubs are still self-led, let alone totally unaffiliated clubs.

Clubs wishing to affiliate must incorporate our published policies into their own, but beyond that are free to exercise self-governance.
